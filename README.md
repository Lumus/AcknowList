## How to Install

CocoaPods is the most common solution to install this library.

1. Add `pod 'AcknowList'` to your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-#target#-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-#target#/` to your main target (drag and drop the file in your Xcode project). Don’t copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked.

## Initialization

The `AcknowListViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController()
navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
```

By default, the controller will try to guess the name of your `.plist` file, based on the bundle name (`Pods-#bundle-name#-acknowledgements.plist`). If that doesn’t match the file you’re looking for, you can initialize the view controller with a custom file name or path.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(fileNamed: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements")
```

``` swift
let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements", ofType: "plist")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(acknowledgementsPlistPath: path)
```

## Customization

If you need to include licenses that are not part of the generated `plist` file, or if you don’t want to use the generated `plist` at all, you can easily create new `Acknow` instances, and set them as the acknowledgements array of the controller.

``` swift
let customLicense = Acknow(title: "...", text: "...")
viewController.acknowledgements = [customLicense]
```

The controller can also display a header and a footer. By default, they are loaded from the generated `plist` file, but you can also directly change the properties values.

``` swift
viewController.headerText = "We love open source software."
viewController.footerText = "Powered by CocoaPods.org"
```

The controller title is a localized value for “acknowledgements”. You might want to use this localized value for the button presenting the controller.

``` swift
button.setTitle(AcknowLocalization.localizedTitle(), for: .normal)
```

If you need to further customize the appearance or behavior of this pod, feel free to subclass its classes.

## Apple TV

AcknowList is also compatible with tvOS for Apple TV apps.
